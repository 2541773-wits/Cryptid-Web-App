            <h1>About Offline Play</h1>
            <p>On some devices, it will be possible to play Cryptid without an internet connection after you have visited the site once. If you can see a green tick in the "Status" box below, you can play without an internet connection.</p>
            <p>To make offline play possible, this site retrieves maps with sets of clues from the server ahead of time, and stores them on your device. The content of the website (images, text) is also stored on the device. If you visit this site without an internet connection, the maps which had been downloaded will be used.</p>
            <p>When you visit the site and are connected to the internet, the store of maps is topped up. You should be able to play offline for a while, but every so often you will need to open up the site with an internet connection to top up the store of available games.</p>
